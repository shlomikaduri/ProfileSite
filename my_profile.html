        <h1>Welcome to My Profile Page</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi All, Welcome to my profile page! I am an Electrical Engineer with over 20 years of experience in the high-tech industry. Recently, I relocated for work to Texas, where I continue to grow in my career.
        </p>

        <h3>Early Beginnings in Technology</h3>
        <p>
            I grew up in Herzliya, Israel, and later lived in Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan. My journey in technology started at a very young age. I began working with computers at 7 years old, when I first used a PC that included a hard disk (back in 1989). My friends and neighbors were fascinated by the technology, and I quickly became the go-to person to teach and repair computers. I even created an early "BBC" style internet site, before the internet was widely available! It ran on my Bezeq phone line, with a regular modem connected to my PC, and the calls were based on the 135 service.
        </p>

        <h3>Education and Military Service</h3>
        <p>
            During high school, I studied electronics, later completing a practical engineering degree. I then served in the Israeli Defense Forces in a development unit, working with advanced technologies and gaining extensive experience in C, embedded systems, CVI, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>Achievements and Patents</h3>
        <p>
            Over the past 20 years, I’ve written two patents for the United States, which are credited to my name. In 2001, I won third place in a national competition for a project that tested VDSL technology. Additionally, my engineering thesis project involved developing a complete system on a chip (SOC) that included VHDL development.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Role and Focus</h3>
        <p>
            In recent years, I have been working with Python, and I’ve built and managed a team of 8 engineers. Currently, I am a Global Manager and lead a team of developers across India, Israel, and the United States. My primary focus is on automation solutions for hardware products, with a strong emphasis on software and hardware integration, primarily using Windows.
